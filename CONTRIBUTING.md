## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Examples

```

Closes #123
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes

## Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Please ensure all new features and bug fixes include appropriate tests.

To run tests:
```bash
pnpm test
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Add comments to explain complex logic
