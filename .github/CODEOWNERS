# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
*       @your-github-username @team-member1 @team-member2

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches files that have a caretaker, only these
# caretakers will receive a request for review.
